**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished Dev Ed's course
- Worked on my portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Taking dev ed's course was a very informative and fun experience, when I started the course I already knew some HTML and CSS, but I learned some cool tricks and techniques. Today I'm not going to post the project because I'm still working on the svg and general styling.
