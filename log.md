## Hey there my gorgeous friends on the internet!

With that quote from [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q), I start my process on document my 100 Days of Code journey to keep me motivated and also improve my English.

**Today's Progress**: 
- Fixed font size on Elena Joy project. 
- Learned about Sass
- Started the portifolio section of creative html5 & css3 course
- Learned more about CSS animations and SVG manipulation

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed working with Sass, it was way more interesting than I thought. I feel happy with my progress today and with that commitment to the challenge, can't wait for tomorrow.

## Day 03: December 25, 2020 

<hr>

**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished Dev Ed's course
- Worked on my portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Taking dev ed's course was a very informative and fun experience, when I started the course I already knew some HTML and CSS, but I learned some cool tricks e techniques. Today I'm not going to post the project because I'm still working on the svg and general styling.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
